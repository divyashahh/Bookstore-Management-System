# Bookstore-Management-System
Created a Java application to manage a bookstore's inventory and facilitate customer transactions. Implemented functionalities include:
-	Inventory Management: Added, removed, and tracked quantities of books, DVDs, and CDs in the store using object-oriented programming principles. 
-	Customer Handling: Developed a system allowing customers to become regular or premium members, tracking their purchases and expenditures. 
-	Cart and Checkout System: Enabled customers to select items, add them to a cart, view the cart contents, and finalize purchases, considering different membership tiers. Utilized Java collections, classes, and user input handling to create a comprehensive system simulating a functional bookstore.
